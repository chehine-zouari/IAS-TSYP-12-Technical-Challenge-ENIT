### **Project Overview: Integrated AI-Driven Logistics and Energy Management**

This project presents two innovative systems designed to transform industrial zones into smart, sustainable environments:  

1. **Energy Management Dashboard System**  
2. **Truck Loading Optimization System**  

Both systems address the critical challenges of energy inefficiency and logistical shortcomings in Tunisia's industrial zones, aligning with the vision for sustainable and intelligent industrial operations by 2056.

### **Integration and Benefits**
The two systems work in synergy:
- The **Energy Management Dashboard** informs the Truck Loading Optimization System of energy patterns, enabling loading during peak renewable energy availability.  
- This integration minimizes energy waste, reduces costs, and contributes to sustainability goals.  

**Key Benefits**:  
- Enhanced operational efficiency and resource utilization.  
- Scalable and adaptable solutions for diverse industrial applications.  
- Significant reductions in carbon emissions.
